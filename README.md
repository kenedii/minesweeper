# Minesweeper with Reinforcement Learning Agents

This project is integrating reinforcement learning (RL) agents into the game Minesweeper, including a Q-Learning agent and a Deep Q-Learning agent, to play Minesweeper autonomously. The agents learn to uncover safe cells and avoid mines through interaction with a Gym environment.

## Features

- **Classic Minesweeper**: Play the traditional game using a Pygame interface.
- **OpenAI Gym Environment**: A custom environment for RL agent training.
- **Reinforcement Learning Agents**:
  - **Random Agent**: A baseline agent that selects actions randomly.
  - **Q-Learning Agent**: Uses a Q-table to learn optimal actions based on expected rewards.
  - **Deep Q-Learning Agent**: Employs a tensorflow neural network to handle state representations.
